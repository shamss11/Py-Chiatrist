Dialectical Behavior Therapy (DBT) and Emotional Regulation:
DBT is a evidence-based psychotherapy that began with efforts to treat borderline personality disorder. It has since been adapted for other mental health problems. DBT focuses on four key areas: mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness. It is particularly helpful for individuals who feel emotions very intensely.

The Neuroscience of Resilience:
Resilience is the process of adapting well in the face of adversity, trauma, tragedy, threats, or significant sources of stress. Neuroscience shows that the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus are key in managing the fear response initiated by the amygdala. Practices like cognitive reappraisal—reframing thoughts to change their emotional impact—can strengthen these neural pathways.

Interpersonal Social Rhythm Therapy (IPSRT):
IPSRT is used to treat mood disorders by focusing on stabilizing daily rhythms, such as sleeping, waking, and eating. Keeping these rhythms consistent helps regulate the body's circadian system, which in turn helps stabilize mood. Research show that disruption in these social rhythms can be a major trigger for mood episodes.

The Impact of Physical Exercise on Brain Chemistry:
Physical activity has been shown to be as effective as some antidepressants for mild to moderate depression. Exercise increases the levels of BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor), which supports the growth and health of neurons. It also releases endorphins and dopamine, providing an immediate boost in mood and long-term improvements in emotional stability.
