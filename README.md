## 🌟 Overview

**Py-Chiatrist** is an intelligent journaling platform designed to bridge the gap between personal reflection and clinical psychology. By utilizing **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**, Py-Chiatrist grounds every conversation in verified behavioral health data sourced from prestigious institutions like **Harvard** and **Oxford**.

The app acts as a digital confidant that focuses exclusively on the mental aspect of well-being. It provides users with a safe space to "vent" through journaling while receiving guidance rooted in behavioral psychology and clinical research—ensuring a more effective and informed support experience.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📚 **Clinical Knowledge Retrieval**
- **Academic RAG**: Intelligently queries a vector database of peer-reviewed papers to provide contextually relevant psychological insights.
- **Fact-Based Guidance**: Explains the "why" behind emotions using established behavioral science rather than generic AI responses.

### ✍️ **Intelligent Journaling Interface**
- **Conversational "Doctor"**: A seamless chat experience that uses Socratic questioning to help users explore their thoughts.
- **Strictly Mental Health**: Engineered to identify and deflect physical health queries, maintaining a clear focus on psychological support.

### 📊 **Behavioral Pattern Analysis**
- **Sentiment Tracking**: Analyzes journal entries to detect primary emotions, intensity, and potential triggers.
- **Mood Visualization**: Offers users a clear look at their mental health trajectory over time through interactive dashboards.

### 🛡️ **Safety & Ethics Layer**
- **Crisis Interceptor**: Real-time scanning for high-risk keywords with immediate redirection to professional emergency resources.
- **Privacy First**: Sensitive journal data is handled with local-first logic and secure storage practices.
